Lem-in
For this project, I used to advance my understanding of link-list, sorting, and search algorithms. The objective of this project is to move a group of ants from the start room to the end room in the most efficient way possible.

Validation
We must first read in a file with the proper structure which includes A start room, end room, number of ants greater than 0 and at least 1 path that leads from the start to the end room. If one of the criteria aren't meet the program should close and print to stdout with the reason for failure.

Building the Data structure
Now that we have validated the file. We will move on to storing each room in a node of a link list that will also hold
